║    This document explains how to properly set up a Raspberry Pi mini computer  ║
║    to act as a Concerto client machine. The basic goal of this is to have a    ║
║    device that, upon starting, will automatically start a Midori browser in    ║
║    fullscreen and send it to the Concerto web page containing the device's     ║
║    specific contents. We also wish to hide the mouse cursor and prevent the    ║
║    device from going to sleep due to inactivity. Also, if the Midori browser   ║
║    were to crash or close, we want to automatically restart the browser as     ║
║    soon as possible.                                                           ║

║                                                                                ║
║    a. Required materials and software                                          ║
║        - Raspberry Pi Model B and a 5V-1A MicroUSB Power Supply                ║
║        - Standard SD card 4GB or more                                          ║
╨        - Raspbery Pi's Wheezy Linux Distro OS                                  ╨
(http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/download.php?file=/images/raspbian/2012-12-16-wheezy-raspbian/2012-12-16-wheezy-raspbian.zip)
╥        - Win32 Imager (https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/+download)     ╥
║                                                                                ║
║    b. Installing the OS                                                        ║
║        - Begin by first formatting the SD card.This can be either a full       ║
║          format or a quick format. If the SD is already formatted then you     ║
║          don't need to bother.                                                 ║
║        - Next run the Win32 Disk Imager program with Adminstrative Privileges. ║
║          Select the drive letter for the SD card and open the Wheezy .img      ║
║          file. Once that's done click the [Write] button.                      ║
║        - Once the program finishes your SD card will now contain the Wheezy    ║
║          OS. The next thing is to test it to make sure it works.               ║
║        - Place the card in the Raspberry Pi and start it up. If it works       ║
║          great! If not, try reinstalling the OS.                               ║
║        - Once the Pi starts up for the first time you will see a blue screen   ║
║          menu. This is for the initial Pi system setup. You can adjust the     ║
║          system timezone, keyboard layout etc. Make sure that the SSH is       ║
║          enabled so you can remote connect to it later on.                     ║
║        - Once you're finished setting that up and have left the menu you will  ║
║          eventually reach a prompt. If you are asked to log in the default     ║
║          user and password are as follows:                                     ║
║              user: pi                                                          ║
║              pass: raspberry                                                   ║
║        - Once your at the "pi@raspberrypi ~ $" prompt, enter the 'startx'      ║
║          command. This will begin the Wheezy GUI program which eventually give ║
║          you a nice desktop and mouse.                                         ║
║        - At this point you are done. When the desktop starts up you can        ║
║          proceed to section 3. Setting up Concerto.                            ║

║    a. Automatic Installation                                                   ║
║       I. Required Files                                                        ║
║          These files should be found in the ConcertoForPi.zip file.            ║
║           - InstallConcertoForPi.sh                                            ║
║           - .crontab                                                           ║
║           - .script                                                            ║
║           - .shoutcast                                                         ║
║      II. Installing Concerto for Pi                                            ║
║           - Extract the files onto the Raspberry Pi. You can do this by        ║
║             either downloading the ConcertoForPi.zip from a network location   ║
║             or by transferring it with a USB flash drive.                      ║
║           - Once extracted, open a command prompt (linux terminal)             ║
║           - Navigate to the extracted files using the cd command               ║
║           - Type the following command:                                        ║
║                 bash InstallConcertoForPi.sh                                   ║
║           - Follow the on-screen instructions and your done! (your mouse       ║
║             should disappear when ever it's not moving. The Raspberry Pi       ║
║             should not turn off while inactive and the Midori browser          ║
║             should begin to automatically start. Music should also play if you ║
║             chose to configure your Pi for a shout cast playback)              ║
║                                                                                ║
║    b. Manual Installation                                                      ║
║       I. Required Software                                                     ║
║          This software must be installed onto the Raspberry Pi                 ║
║           - x11-xserver-utils                                                  ║
║           - unclutter                                                          ║
║           (For ShoutCast)                                                      ║
║           - alsa-utils                                                         ║
║           - mpd                                                                ║
║           - mpc                                                                ║
║          To install the software, open a command prompt and enter the          ║
║          following command:                                                    ║
║              sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils unclutter                  ║
║           (For ShoutCast also enter)                                           ║
║              sudo apt-get install alsa-utils                                   ║
║              sudo echo "snd_bcm2835" >> /etc/modules                           ║
║              sudo apt-get install mpd mpc                                      ║
║              sudo /etc/init.d/mpd stop                                         ║
║              sudo chmod -x /etc/init.d/mpd                                     ║
║      II. Installing the Scripts                                                ║
║          For this you will need the .script and .shoutcast files. This script  ║
║          is what automates opening the Midori browser to the Concerto web page ║
║          and making sure the computer does not fall asleep.                    ║
║           (Concerto Script)                                                    ║
║           - First copy the .script file to the home folder. If you're not sure ║
║             where that is, enter the following into a terminal: echo $HOME     ║
║           - Rename the file to "digitalsignage.sh"                             ║
║           - Next, open the file in a text editor and just after the line       ║
║             'LOG="./digitalsignage.log"' add the following on its own line:    ║
║                ConcertoServerIP="<CONCERTO_URL>"                               ║
║           - Replacing <CONCERTO_URL> with either the web URL or IP address of  ║
║             the Concerto server.                                               ║
║           - Save the document and move on to the next step.                    ║
║           (ShoutCast Script)                                                   ║
║           - First copy the .shoutcast file to the home folder. If you're not   ║
║             sure where that is, enter the following into a terminal:echo $HOME ║
║           - Rename the file to "shoutcast-radio.sh"                            ║
║           - Next, open the file in a text editor and just after the first two  ║
║             lines (which are just file comments) add the following on its own  ║
║             line: shoutcast_radio_link="<SHOUTCAST_URL>"                       ║
║           - Replacing <SHOUTCAST_URL> with either the web URL or IP address    ║
║             and port of the Concerto server.                                   ║
║           - Save the document and move on to the next step.                    ║
║     III. Setting up the Cron Job                                               ║
║           - Open a terminal and enter the following command:                   ║
║                 crontab -eu $USER                                              ║
║           - You should now see a command line text editor. Scroll down to the  ║
║             bottom of the file and add the following line (include every       ║
║             character including the *s):                                       ║
║      * * * * * export DISPLAY=:0 && /bin/bash $HOME/digitalsignage.sh          ║
║            (For ShoutCast also add the following line beneath the previous)    ║
║      @reboot   /bin/bash $HOME/shoutcast-radio.sh &> $HOME/shoutcast-radio.log ║
║           - Once done, save the document and close. If the editor does not     ║
║             show instructions on how to do so it is most likely the 'vim'      ║
║             editor. To exit hit [Esc] and then enter ':x' and hit enter. That  ║
║             should save and close the document.                                ║
║      IV. Setting up AutoLogin                                                  ║
║           - First, open the .bashrc file that is located in /home/pi. This is  ║
║             a hidden file so you may need to right click and select the        ║
║             "Show Hidden" option.                                              ║
║           - Once it is open in a text editor, scroll to the very bottom and    ║
║             add the following three lines of code and then save the file.      ║
║                 if [ "`/bin/ps -A | /bin/grep -o -E "startx"`" == "" ]; then   ║
